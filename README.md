## What Does This Plugin Do?  
TOTP is a widely used authentication mechanism that generates a unique, time-sensitive code based on a shared secret and the current time. This code is typically used as a second factor in authentication (2FA), adding an extra layer of security to protect against unauthorized access.  

This plugin enhances security by wrapping the existing access controls under a TOTP verification process. Users must enter a valid TOTP code generated by an authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator) to gain access, reducing the risk of unauthorized logins even if credentials are compromised.
